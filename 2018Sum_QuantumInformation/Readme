Organizer: Professor Michael Mulligan

Message:
There is some interest in learning about various aspect of quantum information this summer. 
I thought we might follow these notes (and supplement as needed): https://mcgreevy.physics.ucsd.edu/s18/2018-239-lectures.pdf. 
The idea would be meet for 1.5 hrs once or twice a week and cover various sections of these notes.
Subsequent meeting times may change. 
I'll assume (unless told otherwise) that only those who show up are interested in receiving emails in the future.


Talk list:
